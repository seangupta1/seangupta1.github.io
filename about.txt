I am a Computer Science MS student at the University of Missouri – Kansas City.  I am transitioning to a career in technology after nearly a decade as a first responder in emergency medical services, where I developed the ability to solve complex problems, make high-stakes decisions under pressure, and work effectively as part of a team. My background motivates me to focus on solving problems that have a meaningful, positive impact on the lives of others. I am particularly interested in artificial intelligence and how it could be utilized to improve processes and decision making across many critical fields. I am eager to continue learning, tackle challenging projects, and bring a disciplined, people-focused perspective to my work.
